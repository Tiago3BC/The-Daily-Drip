# The Daily Drip

The Daily Drip is an interactive data visualization and analytics web application that provides insights into daily rainfall and precipitation patterns. Built using Python, Streamlit, and Plotly, this application displays charts and statistics related to rainfall intensity, total precipitation, and other weather-related metrics over various time periods.

## Features

- **Interactive Dashboards**: Two dashboards that allow users to explore precipitation data for different time periods.
- **Visualizations**: Interactive charts, including donut charts and bar charts, to display rainfall intensity and daily totals.
- **Data Filtering**: Users can select start and end dates to filter data dynamically.
- **Rain Intensity Analysis**: Display breakdowns of rain intensity, such as mild, moderate, and heavy rainfall.
- **Data Export**: Option to view raw data in tables.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The main programming language used for data analysis and app development.
- **Streamlit**: Framework for building interactive web apps quickly and easily.
- **Plotly**: For creating interactive and visually appealing charts.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis library.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
